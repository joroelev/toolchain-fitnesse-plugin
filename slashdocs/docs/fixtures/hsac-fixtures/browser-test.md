### Actions on the page

##### scroll to &lt;place&gt; (in &lt;container&gt;)
Scrolls the viewport of the browser to make sure the place (a locator) is visible.
Optionally you can constrain the place to a container (the 'in' part), this will result that the place within the container gets scrolled into view.

##### scroll elements to center of viewport &lt;scrollElementsToCenterOfViewport&gt;

the element is scrolled 'just into view'. This often prevents elements to be scrolled behind floating menu-bars or footers if these are present. 

##### set search context to &lt;container&gt;
Limits searches for places by other keywords/commands to inside the container (a locator) instead of the whole page.
This is useful in case the same place occurs multiple times on the same page, to ensure which one is found.
All subsequent searches are limited to ‘container’ until either the ‘clear search context’, ‘refresh’ or ‘open’ command is given.
Many commands also offer an ‘in container’ version (e.g. ‘click place in container’) to limit searching only for that row.

Note that xpath locator starting with '//' will ignore any given search context.

##### refresh search context
Refreshes the search context previously set in case it has gone stale. This is a workaround for when an element previously used for the search context has been replaced.

##### clear search context
Removes any search limits previously set by ‘set search context’: subesquent searches will search the entire page.

Waits until the tag with tagName contains the text expectedText.

##### wait for visible &lt;place&gt; (in &lt;container&gt;)
Waits until the mentioned place (a locator) is visible on the page.
Optionally you can constrain the place to a container (the 'in' part), this will result that the browser waits until the place within the container is visible.
The container can be defined using a locator. When using a container the place has to be present within it, otherwise you will eventually get a timeout.

##### wait for x path visible &lt;xPath&gt;
Waits until the xpath defined by xPath is visible.
